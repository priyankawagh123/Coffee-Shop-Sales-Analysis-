# ☕Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis | SQL + Python + Power BI 
This project explores transactional data from a coffee shop. Using SQL for querying insights, Python for data cleaning and preprocessing, and Power BI for interactive visualizations, it uncovers key business insights to support data-driven decisions.

# 🔧 Tools Used:
- SQL (SQLite or MySQL) – Data querying and analysis
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – Data cleaning, transformation, and EDA
- Power BI – Dashboard design and business reporting
- Excel/CSV – Source dataset handling

  
# 📊Key Insights & Features:
  - 📈 Sales Trends: Visualized daily/monthly revenue trends to identify peak seasons.
  - 🏷️ Top Products: Analyzed best-selling items to focus on profitable products.
  - 🕒 Peak Hours: Identified high footfall times for staffing optimization.
  - 🌍 Location-wise Sales: Compared sales across branches (if multiple locations exist).
  - 📦 Product Category Performance: Grouped by category to see which type performs best.
  - 💳 Payment Type Analysis: Understand customer preferences for payment methods.
  
# 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out:
  **🔄 End-to-End Pipeline:**
  - Covers full data journey — from raw CSV to professional dashboard — showing real-world workflow.

  **🧠 Multi-Tool Stack:**
  - Uses SQL for logic, Python for wrangling, and Power BI for visual storytelling — a highly desirable skill combination for analysts.

  **📊 Interactive Dashboard:**
  - Power BI visuals with slicers and filters allow dynamic exploration of sales patterns.

  **🧹Clean, Modular Code:**
  - Clear separation of scripts for SQL, Python and Power BI enhances reusability and readability.

  **💡Business-Oriented Insights:**
  - Focuses on actionable outcomes like best-selling items, peak hours, and payment preferences — not just technical metrics.

  **🎓Perfect for Job Portfolios:**
  - Showcases analytical thinking, data skills, and presentation — ideal for resumes or interviews.

  # 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)
  **Before analysis, the dataset was thoroughly cleaned using Python and Pandas:**

**🔍 Missing Values:** Identified and handled missing entries (e.g., filling, removing).

**🔄 Data Type Corrections:** Converted columns like Transaction_Date to datetime, and ensured numeric columns (e.g., Quantity, Total_Amount) had proper types.

**✂️ Duplicate Removal:** Removed exact duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

**🔠 Text Standardization:** Cleaned column entries for consistency (e.g., product names, payment methods).

**📁 Export:** Saved the cleaned dataset as a new CSV for further use in SQL and Power BI.
