# ☕Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis | SQL +  Power BI 
This project explores transactional data from a coffee shop. Using SQL for querying insights, Python for data cleaning and preprocessing, and Power BI for interactive visualizations, it uncovers key business insights to support data-driven decisions.

# 🔧 Tools Used:
- SQL (SQLite or MySQL) – Data querying and analysis
- Power BI – Dashboard design and business reporting
- Excel/CSV – Source dataset handling

# 📊 Key Insights & Features:
    📈 Sales Trends: Visualized daily/monthly revenue trends to identify peak seasons.
    🏷️ Top Products: Analyzed best-selling items to focus on profitable products.
    🕒 Peak Hours: Identified high footfall times for staffing optimization.
    🌍 Location-wise Sales: Compared sales across branches (if multiple locations exist).
    📦 Product Category Performance: Grouped by category to see which type performs best.
    💳 Payment Type Analysis: Understand customer preferences for payment methods.

# 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out:
  🔄 End-to-End Pipeline: Covers full data journey — from raw CSV to professional dashboard — showing real-world workflow.

  🧠 Multi-Tool Stack: Uses SQL for logic, Python for wrangling, and Power BI for visual storytelling — a highly desirable skill combination for analysts.

  📊 Interactive Dashboard: Power BI visuals with slicers and filters allow dynamic exploration of sales patterns.

  🧹 Clean, Modular Code: Clear separation of scripts for SQL, and Power BI enhances reusability and readability.

  💡 Business-Oriented Insights: Focuses on actionable outcomes like best-selling items, peak hours, and payment preferences — not just technical metrics.

  🎓 Perfect for Job Portfolios: Showcases analytical thinking, data skills, and presentation — ideal for resumes or interviews.
